**TextWrap** is a JavaScript module that does text wrapping and filling, similar to the `textwrap` module in Python. This module was created by Rangga Fajar Oktariansyah and directly inspired by Python's `textwrap`, with the goal of bringing similar functionality to the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Background

In the development of text-based applications, such as terminals, CLI tools, or even simple user interfaces, it is often necessary to format text so that it appears neater and easier to read. One commonly used technique is "text wrapping" where text that is too long will be separated into multiple lines without cutting words randomly. In addition, some text also needs to be set with certain indents for layout purposes.

In Python, the `textwrap` module has become a standard solution for this purpose. However, in JavaScript, a similar feature is not available by default in the Node.js environment or the browser, so TextWrap comes to fill this void.

## Key Features

1. **Text Wrapping:** TextWrap allows you to wrap text into multiple lines based on a predefined width. This module is capable of handling various cases, such as tabulated text, over-spaced text, and others.
2. **Text Indentation:** You can specify indentation for the first line and subsequent lines separately. This is useful in creating a more organized text structure.
3. **Spacing and Tabulation Handling:** This module comes with options to replace tabulation with spaces, remove extra spaces, and ensure that each sentence end is followed by two spaces for better readability.
4. **Word Separation Settings:** TextWrap supports intelligent word separation, including options to separate long words and set how hyphenated words should be treated.
5. **Advanced Options:** The module also provides some advanced options such as maximum line handling, placeholders for truncated text, and others.

## Development Objective

TextWrap was developed to make it easier for JavaScript developers to manage long text in a more organized and structured way. Using a similar approach to Python modules, TextWrap provides flexibility and adaptability for developers already familiar with Python, as well as a strong option for those developing text-based applications in JavaScript.

With TextWrap, text organization in both Node.js and frontend applications becomes simpler and more effective, allowing developers to focus on other aspects of application development without having to worry about complex text formatting.
